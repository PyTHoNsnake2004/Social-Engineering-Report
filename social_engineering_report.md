# Research Report: Social Engineering Attacks

## 1. Introduction
- Define social engineering (psychology-based attacks).
- State why it's a major threat (bypasses all technical security).
- Mention that humans are often the "weakest link" in security.

## 2. Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks

### a) Phishing
- **What it is:** Fraudulent emails/texts that appear to be from reputable sources.
- **Goal:** To steal sensitive data like login credentials or credit card numbers.
- **Example:** An email pretending to be from "Netflix Support" asking you to update your payment details via a fake link.

### b) Pretexting
- **What it is:** Creating a fabricated scenario (a pretext) to steal information.
- **Goal:** To gain the target's trust and exploit it to access private data.
- **Example:** A caller pretends to be from the IT department and needs your password to "install critical updates."

### c) Baiting
- **What it is:** Offering something enticing to lure a victim into a trap.
- **Goal:** To get the victim to install malware or reveal information.
- **Example:** Leaving infected USB drives labeled "Confidential Salaries" in a company parking lot.

### d) Quid Pro Quo
- **What it is:** Offering a service or benefit in exchange for information or access.
- **Goal:** To trade a fake service for a real security compromise.
- **Example:** A scammer calls offering free IT support, but instead installs remote access software.

### e) Tailgating
- **What it is:** Gaining physical access to a restricted area by following someone else.
- **Goal:** To bypass physical security controls.
- **Example:** An attacker carrying boxes asks an employee to hold the door open, then walks into a secure office.

## 3. Real-World Case Studies

### Case Study 1: The Twitter Bitcoin Scam (2020)
- **Attack Type:** Phishing (and likely pretexting).
- **What happened:** Hackers targeted Twitter employees with a phone spear-phishing attack, tricking them into giving access to internal admin tools. They then took over prominent accounts (like Obama, Biden, Musk) and tweeted a Bitcoin scam.
- **Impact:** Over $100,000 stolen, massive reputational damage to Twitter.

### Case Study 2: The Target Data Breach (2013)
- **Attack Type:** Pretexting/Phishing.
- **What happened:** Attackers first stole login credentials from a heating and air conditioning company that worked with Target. They used this foothold to access Target's network and install malware on point-of-sale systems.
- **Impact:** Data of 110 million customers stolen.

## 4. The Psychology Behind Social Engineering
Explain *why* these attacks work by mentioning principles like:
- **Authority:** People tend to obey authority figures.
- **Urgency:** Creating a false sense of urgency causes people to bypass normal procedures.
- **Scarcity:** The idea that something is in short supply makes people want it more.
- **Familiarity/Liking:** People are more likely to trust someone they like or feel familiar with.

## 5. Impact on Organizations
- **Financial Loss:** Theft of funds, ransomware payments.
- **Data Breaches:** Loss of customer data, intellectual property theft.
- **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust.
- **Operational Disruption:** Downtime, cost of incident response.

## 6. Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

### a) For Individuals:
- Be skeptical of unsolicited requests for information.
- Verify the identity of anyone requesting sensitive data.
- Do not plug unknown USB drives into your computer.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA).

### b) For Organizations:
- **Security Awareness Training:** Regular training to recognize attacks.
- **Strict Access Controls:** Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).
- **Clear Security Policies:** For handling information and physical access.
- **Simulated Phishing Tests:** To train employees.
- **Incident Response Plan:** To respond quickly if an attack occurs.

## 7. Conclusion
- Social engineering is a pervasive and highly effective threat.
- Technical security measures are useless if the human element is ignored.
- Continuous education and a culture of security are the best defenses.
